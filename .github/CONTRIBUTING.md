## Style Guide

We try to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) as much as possible to make our code reader friendly.

We differ from PEP8 in that we allow 120 characters long lines. (PyCharm default)


## Pull Requests

We prefer shorter pull requests over longer (in terms of written lines of Python code). That makes it easier for us to review the pull request.

Please refer to your initial issue in the comments of the pull request.

## Tests

We run our tests with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and we would prefer if you do so for the pull requests.

All pull requests are checked with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) it make sure new functionality does not break old.
